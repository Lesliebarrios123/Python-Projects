# Python-Projects
Hello these are some of the projects that I have worked on with python.
-Tick Tac Toe-
This is a small program that will loop through one game of Tic Tac Toe.
-Basic encryption and decryption-
This file is a program that will take words and encrypt based on the number that is given.
It will also take encrypted string with spaces as well as the number of letters it was shift by and decrypt it.
